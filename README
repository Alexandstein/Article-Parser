News article parser
-------------------
	This is just a personal project of mine which I am using to streamline  posting
news articles to a science blog from command line. Eventually it will be more cleaned up
and streamlined (also including more news site formats) but for now it's a rough outline
that only parses Gawker media's io9 articles and ScienceDaily.

-------------------
Software used
-------------------
	Besides the Python standard libraries this parser also uses BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
and Tumblr-rb for posting from the command line.

-------------------
Usage
-------------------
	Usage is fairly simple at this point, after changing the __main__ section to the desired
blog to post to. You run the script in Terminal with the url of an article as an 
argument. From there it posts to the drafts of the selected blog. (Though this can be 
changed in the YAML temlate file.)


-------------------
Updates
-------------------
Will add:
	-More streamlined functionality
	-Support for Physorg and Scientific American
	-Better modularization.
